pixel7a,Prabhu Jagannathan,5,Terrific,('This is a perfect replacement for OnePlus 6 and Pixel 4a! Am super excited and happy. The built quality is top notch. photo and video recording quality are excellent. Got first security update once I got connected to the network. Go for it.',)
pixel7a,Ganesh Karthick,5,Must buy!,("As someone who's used an iPhone 12 and iOS. the Pixel 7a is my first Android phone with a premium software experience. It feels refreshing to use such a high-quality product. although I'm not entirely convinced by the hardware just yet. I only received it today. so it's possible that the warming up and battery drainage issues are due to initial setup. I expect things to improve over time.In terms of the build. the Pixel 7a has a very premium look. but it doesn't feel quite as good in the ha...",)
pixel7a,Basudeb Moulik,3,Fair,("Hi. first of all thanks to flipkart for the speedy delivery and delivering it before time. First of all let me start with the looks of the phone. it's a 6.1 inch full HD plus oled display. The colours are just too good.Lets talk about the camera. I think this beats any other smartphone at this price range. Cameras are just flagship level and the colours are so accurate.The speakers quality is top notch too.Now the cons:Dear google this phone feels like a heater releasing heat this summer....",)
pixel7a,Faisal Mansoor,5,Excellent,('If you are a Pixel lover then you dont need any reason to buy this one just go for it. However The Pixel 7a is the best mid-range Android phone available. It squeezes even more of the premium smartphone experience into a smaller. cheaper model.Pros: brilliant camera. excellent smaller screen. top performance. decent battery life. wireless charging. face and fingerprint unlock. water resistance. recycled aluminium and plastic. five years of security updates. Android 13. smart software featur...',)
pixel7a,sanjay bisht,5,Awesome,("Pixal 7a (sea.128) is a remarkable device that combines top-notch camera quality with a compact and portable design. Its primary camera captures stunning photos with clarity. vibrant colors. and impressive detail. The phone's low-light performance is exceptional. allowing you to capture memorable moments even in challenging lighting conditions. With its versatile camera modes and settings. including manual mode and AI-enhanced features. this phone caters to a variety of photography styles. Ad...",)
pixel7a,Vishwanath Ucchaid,3,Does the job,("Overheating issue. It gets hot way faster than my 6a.Also. if you scroll slowly. you feel like 60hz is not 60hz at all. Probably might get fixed by software updates.  Apart from these two. it's a good phone but feature wise. not a big jump from 6a. The camera is a little bit better than the 6a.If you are planning for a stable phone which runs cool and smooth. i would recommend 6a.",)
pixel7a,Diptanu Das,5,Highly recommended,('The smartest phone in the world.Google always stays top in terms of cameras and software optimisation.Pixel 7a is the pinnacle of mobile photography.The battery is quite good and it charges fast enough. first time when you will charge it will have a slow charge then after that it is pretty fast if u use the Google charger.No bloatware no ads nothing clean look. #googlepixel #cleanui',)
pixel7a,Dilpreet Sidhu,5,Worth every penny,("Premium looking and buttery smooth response..Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health).Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery.It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature)Overall performance is great but AI features are making...",)
pixel7a,Srinivas Bhargav,5,Must buy!,("I loved this! The camera is a beast if you know how to use it. Performance is also good for the price. The features are loaded in this phone that's something wow!! Overall best mid range yet flagship phone I would say. Camera is a top notch at this range of mobiles!",)
pixel7a,Madhav Narayanan,1,Did not meet expectations,('The phone will not connect to Jio network. Spoke to the Google support team. did all the troubleshooting steps. reset network settings. reset the phone to factory settings. nothing works. Only works when connected to wifi. So much for a device from the great company Google! Stay away. Go for OnePlus or Samsung. I am now waiting for Google to pick my device and fix it.',)
